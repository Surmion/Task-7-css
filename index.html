            <h3>My Chilhood</h3>
            <p>
              Some of the best times in my childhood. Those days are full of
              incredible memories that you'll cherish forever. I learn to
              believe in myself that I can achieve anything I set my mind to
              during my childhood. Spending time with my family and childhood
              friends is one of the things that makes my childhood so fun and
              wonderful.

            <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
            <p>
              In my teenage lif my school is a location where I spend a lot of
              time with my friends. Those days, I believe my friends understand
              me better than my parents. My parents claim I'm no longer a child
              and want me to act like one. They, on the other hand, treat me
              like a child, counseling me on everything I do. I need some
              distance, and I want them to truly trust in me. It's difficult to
              know when to act like a child and when not to.

            <h3>My Adulthood</h3>

            <p>
              Adulthood, according to most people, begins between the ages of 18
              and 21, but I believe that actions, not ages, define adulthood.
              Adulthood necessitates responsibility, behavior control, emotional
              control, financial control, and social control. You could be
              considered an adult at any age if you have those characteristics.
              In my case, I discovered this as soon as I entered college.

                &#10084; Slipknot is an American heavy metal band formed in Des
                Moines, Iowa, in 1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer
                Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup
                changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for
                more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, Craig Jones, Mick
                Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris Fehn, and Jim Root.
                Bassist Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during
                2011-2014 by Donnie Steele. Jordison was dismissed from the band
                on December 12, 2013.

              <figcaption>
                &#10084; Pinoy style carbonara is from its name a Filipino take
                on the pasta dish of the same name which originated in Italy.
                This pasta makes use of bacon and mushrooms partnered with a
                thick creamy sauce and smothered with cheese. This became the
                staple style over the years, since Filipinos love sweeter and
                creamier types of food in general.
